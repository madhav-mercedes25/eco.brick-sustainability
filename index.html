  <h2>What Are Ecobricks?</h2>
  <p>Ecobricks are plastic bottles packed tightly with non-biodegradable waste such as wrappers, bags, and packaging. They prevent this waste from entering landfills, waterways, or being incinerated, which helps reduce pollution and protect the environment.</p>

<section id="why">
  <h2>Why Ecobricks?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>üåç Environmental Protection:</strong> Reduces plastic pollution and prevents the formation of harmful microplastics.</li>
    <li><strong>üß± Waste Management:</strong> Reuses non-recyclable plastic and reduces the load on landfills and incinerators.</li>
    <li><strong>üèóÔ∏è Practical Construction:</strong> Ecobricks can be used to build walls, furniture, and small structures, especially in under-resourced areas.</li>
    <li><strong>üß† Education & Awareness:</strong> Encourages people to rethink their plastic use and teaches sustainable habits through hands-on action.</li>
    <li><strong>üå± Community Empowerment:</strong> Brings people together for meaningful environmental action and education for all ages.</li>
  </ul>

<section id="how">
  <h2>How to Make an Ecobrick</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Find a clean, dry plastic bottle.</li>
    <li>Collect clean, dry non-recyclable plastic waste (wrappers, bags, etc.).</li>
    <li>Use a stick to pack the plastic tightly into the bottle.</li>
    <li>Ensure the bottle is solid and heavy when finished.</li>
    <li>Label it with your name and weight if needed. Store it safely.</li>
  </ol>

<section id="impact">
  <h2>Impact of Ecobricks</h2>
  <p>From 1950 to 2020, global plastic production surged from 2 million to nearly 500 million tonnes. It is projected to reach 838 million tonnes by 2035. Ecobricks offer a practical solution to reuse this non-recyclable plastic safely and productively.</p>
  <p><strong>Our Progress So Far:</strong> We've successfully created six Ecobricks and continue to spread awareness on their environmental benefits. Small actions like this can protect millions of terrestrial and aquatic species.</p>

  <h2>About This Project</h2>
  <p>This project was created by Madhav R. Nair & Sidharth Jayakrishnan to educate others about sustainable alternatives to plastic waste. Our goal is to empower communities to take charge of plastic pollution using simple, effective solutions like Ecobricks.</p>
